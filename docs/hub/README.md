# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Hub API

Official utilities to use the Hugging Face hub API, still very experimental.

```
npm add @huggingface/hub
```

## Usage

For some of the calls, you need to create an account and generate an [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

```ts
import { createRepo, commit, deleteRepo, listFiles } from "@huggingface/hub";
import type { RepoId, Credentials } from "@huggingface/hub";

const repo: RepoId = { type: "model", name: "myname/some-model" };
const credentials: Credentials = { accessToken: "hf_..." };

await createRepo({ repo, credentials, license: "mit" });
